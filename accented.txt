I'm reading in Spanish words from a text file, 
with characters like · and Ò. Then I'm separating them into groups and 
writing them to new text files. The Strings with accent marks look fine in 
the input text file and look fine in the output text file. However, some of 
the logic in that separates them in the groups is behaving incorrectly. This 
is because accented characters are treated as multiple characters in the 
logic, i.e. · is treated as √°. So for example, the logic thinks c·diz and 
c·liz have the same first 3 letters (c√°), when in fact they only have the 
same first 2 letters (c·). So c·diz and c·liz are both put in the c√° 
output file, instead of c·diz in the c·d file and c·liz in the c·l file.

How do I get the logic to treat accented characters correctly? How do I 
get c·diz in the c·d file and c·liz in the c·l file?

Does it have something to do with Locale? If so, exactly what code do 
I need to write, because I've been messing around with Locale for a 
while now with no luck.
